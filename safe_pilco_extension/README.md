## Safe PILCO extension
In this folder, we include an extension of the standard PILCO algorithm that takes safety constraints (defined on the environment's state space) into account as in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05556](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05556.pdf). The `safe_swimmer_run.py` and `safe_cars_run.py` in the `../examples` folder demonstrate the use of this extension.
